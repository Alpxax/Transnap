The Transnap application is an instant translation application that I made.
Working logic: (This is just an example, there are many languages)
For example, you will search for something in Russian on Google, but you do not know Russian. With this application, you can write in your own language and translate it to Russian with a single click
You will write in a language you do not know to someone on a social media platform, you can translate what you wrote to the language you want with a single click.
